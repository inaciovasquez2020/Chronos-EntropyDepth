###  Institutional Verification
* **Registry ID:** `ART-CHRON-01`
* **Status:** Framework / Conditional (Definitions Locked)
* **Framework Alignment:** Unified Rigidity Framework (URF) — Temporal Invariants
* **Core Constraint:** Structural Non-Amplification

## Significance Statement
The **Chronos / EntropyDepth** repository serves as the canonical reference for temporal rigidity within the URF. It defines the **Chronos Operator**, which governs how structural stability persists over time. By establishing **EntropyDepth Invariants**, this framework proves the **Non-Amplification Principle**: the structural complexity (entropy) of a rigid system cannot grow beyond the bounds defined by its initial logic-width dependency.

## Core Results
* **Chronos Operator:** The formal state-transition operator for time-invariant rigidity.
* **EntropyDepth Invariants:** Mathematical bounds on the depth of information processing within a finite structure.
* **Non-Amplification Principles:** Proving that rigidity walls prevent the cascading growth of entropy in closed operator systems.

## Mathematical Context
Chronos is analyzed as the operator $\mathcal{T}$ that preserves the spectral gap $\lambda_1$ across temporal shifts. The **EntropyDepth** ($\text{ED}$) is constrained such that:
$$\text{ED}(\mathcal{T}) \le \Phi(k, tw)$$
This ensures that the "logic-width" $k$ remains sufficient to characterize the system's stability as it evolves, preventing "structural decay."

## Artifacts & Lifecycle
* **Definitions:** Locked (v1.0.0).
* **Core Theorems:** Conditional on final enumeration of the SIGC preorder.
* **Future Documentation:** Citable manuscripts and machine-readable certificates are forthcoming as part of the URF-SG standard.
